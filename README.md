# PS5 Checker

I want a PS5

---

There are two components here, one is React Native and other is NodeJs Web scraper.

I initially wanted to implement a React Native Expo app with push notifications but push notifications takes too long to get a buzz on the phone while the phone is locked.
Thus, the React Native component is unnecessary to run and I have commented out the push notification feature in the `nodejs` folder

## How to run

1. Go to `nodejs` folder and run `npm install`
2. Run `node ./main.js`
3. Console will show status of each poll so will need to leave your monitor on
4. If there is stock, it will automatically open the url to the site on your default browser and you do the rest

**Known issue:** Sometimes the Axios GET request hangs

I got a PS5 within a week so I won't be updating this anymore :)
